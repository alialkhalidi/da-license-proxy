## GML: Get Me a License, fronts an appsim server, and gets a DA license for an MYAM user to be used for IDVS getAndMatchData call
### Use:
- go install gml
- bin/gml gmlserverconfig.yml

### TODO:
- Handle Lockbox creation: currently, the code only handles Lockbox recovery. The usecase of performance testing assumes "warmed" users, but this can be changed to improve support.
